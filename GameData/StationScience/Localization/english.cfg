    #autoLOC_nutrition_LaytheInSpace = Tests are showing high amounts of sodium in the nutritional values, need to invest in more hydration for the creatures.
    #autoLOC_nutrition_VallInSpace = Hmmm... either there appears to be a sudden increase of moisture in the food processed here or you have seriously misread the cook book.

    #autoLOC_irradiatedPlant_SunInSpace = Nope! The plants are now not enjoying this one bit! The exposure to kuarqs has made the plant's averse to the constant sunlight.
    #autoLOC_irradiatedPlant_MohoInSpace = You find the plants are emitting heat! May have to syphon glykerol to upgrade the A/C.
    #autoLOC_irrdiatedPlant_MohoSrfLanded = Well the kuarqs are certainly enjoying the shade that being inside the plants is giving them...

    #autoLOC_irradiatedPlant_IkeInSpace = The Research Lab seems to be a lot darker since exposing the plants here... Must check light bulbs.
    #autoLOC_irrdiatedPlant_IkeSrfLanded = Well the kuarqs ability to absorb more UV is making the plants very self-suffcient... Grow-in-the-dark snacks?

    #autoLOC_irrdiatedPlant_LaytheSrfLanded = Hmmm... the kuarq-irradiated plants seem to show high levels of sour, will get the creatures in the lab to confirm the taste...
    #autoLOC_irradiatedPlant_VallInSpace = Fascinating! The absorption rate of kuarqs is also in perfect sync with each plant...
    #autoLOC_irrdiatedPlant_VallSrfLanded = After returning to the lab after a nap, you observe the plants have frosted over and the kuarqs a hugging each other for warmth...
    #autoLOC_irradiatedPlant_TyloInSpace = You have noted the plants are requiring a lot less atmosphere to grow, great for adapting to Tylo!
    #autoLOC_irrdiatedPlant_TyloSrfLanded = The kuarqs are feeling suddenly very carefree since being infused into plants.
    #autoLOC_irradiatedPlant_BopInSpace = Erm.... You think have just popped a new potential snack... Bopcorn?

    #autoLOC_irrdiatedPlant_PolSrfLanded = The irradiated-kuarqs are casuing the plants to produce more pollen then normal... Having hayfever is a nightmare here!
    #autoLOC_irradiatedPlant_EelooInSpace = Amazing!, the thermometer confirms the plants are colder than the ambient temperature of the lab.
    #autoLOC_irrdiatedPlant_EelooSrfLanded = Damn! being on the edge of the system as caused a "leakage" of kuarqs from the plants, the creatures are showing signs of kuarq-like behaviour!

    #autoLOC_expBioGoovolution_description = Tier: 3 \nCategory: Physics / Kuarqs \n \nAlthough the Mystery Goo was discovered on Kerbin and has not caused any “negative” impacts on our home… we think. We would like to see what would happen if you introduced Mystery Goo that has been refined to some isolated plantlife… Good Luck! You will need a TH-NKR Research Lab, Y-CKY Goo Chamber and CL-EN Goo Refinery for this experiment. Note: don't attach directly to your station, unless you intend to return it to the surface.

    #autoLOC_expTransgenicAgriculture_title = Radical Experiment: Transgenic Agriculture
    #autoLOC_expTransgenicAgriculture_description = Tier: 4 \nCategory: Biology / Plants \n \nIn our conquest to colonise the Kerbol system, the boffins on Kerbin have decided that the best way to create "altered" plant life that would be able to provide snacks on any planet, is to blast the poor seedlings provided with as much eccentric kuarqs without blowing the cyclotron's flux capacitor and literally rewrite their DNA! Who knows what bombarding this plantlife with highly unstable kuarqs will do?!, yet alone feeding the resulting biomass to the creatures! You will need a TH-NKR Research Lab, a F-RRY Zoology Bay and 2x D-ZZY Cyclotrons. Note: don't attach directly to your station, you MUST return it to the surface to complete. 

    #autoLOC_expSuperCreature_title = Radical Experiment: Super Creature Genesis
    #autoLOC_expSuperCreature_description = Tier: 4 \nCategory: Physiology / Creatures \n \nThe bosses down on Kerbin have gone potty! and have decided to send up instructions for an experimental goo serum and equipment to inject it into some poor creatures and then blast them with kuarqs to try to give em' super powers?! This will need a enormous amount of resources and it's hard to say what will happen, Good Luck! You will need a TH-NKR Research Lab, a F-RRY Zoology Bay and 2x D-ZZY Cyclotron. Note: don't attach directly to your station, you MUST return it to the surface to complete.

    #autoLOC_expParticleFusion_title = Radical Experiment: Nu-Kuarq Particle Fusion
    #autoLOC_expParticleFusion_description = Tier: 4 \nCategory: Physics / Kuarqs \n \nLet's find out what happens when you generate both prograde and retrograde kuarqs and then smash em' together inside the Goo Chamber using the Goo hopefully as a stabilising agent to prevent “explosive” reactions…. These theortetical particles can't be created on Kerbin so you will have to send the collided kuarqs back to Kerbin in the magnetic containment vessels inside the pod. You will need a TH-NKR Research Lab, 2x D-ZZY Cyclotron and a WT-SIT Spectrometron to perform the experiment. Note: don't attach directly to your station, you MUST return it to the surface to complete.

    #autoLOC_expSolvedGoo_title = Radical Experiment: Solved Goo™ Alchemy
    #autoLOC_expSolvedGoo_description = Tier: 4 \nCategory: Chemistry / Goo \n \nThe boffins at the Directorate on Kerbin believe they finally have the missing ingredient to unlocking the Mystery Goo once and for all! Mwhahahaha cough cough ...sorry! Erm… yeah the idea is to launch this highly experimental pod with cutting edge tech then refine some Mystery Goo and… fire high-energy kuarqs at it to reveal it’s secrets… what could possibly go wrong?. You will need a TH-NKR Research Lab, 2x D-ZZY Cyclotrons, Y-CKY Goo Chamber and a CL-EN Goo Refinery for this experiment. Note: don't attach directly to your station, unless you intend to return it to the surface.
