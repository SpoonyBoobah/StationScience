# Station Science ReNewed (v3.0)

## Overview

**Station Science**, originally developed by **@ethernet**, adds large, advanced research parts for space stations to conduct long-term experiments. These experiments generate valuable Science points, helping you progress through the tech tree and expand your knowledge of the Kerbal universe. This mod is ideal for creating research stations orbiting various celestial bodies, requiring strategic planning and resource management.

The mod has undergone several updates, maintained by **@tomforwood** and **@linuxgurugamer**, and is now part of the **Spoony Industries** family under the development of **@spoonyboobah**. The acquisition of the Station Science Directorate by **Spoony Kerman** promises exciting new developments and additional funding for future research projects!

## Parts and Experiments

### Key Parts:
- **TH-NKR Research Lab**: Generates *Eurekas* for scientific experiments.
- **F-RRY Zoology Bay**: Performs biological experiments, requiring *Kibbal*.
- **D-ZZY Cyclotron**: Generates *Kuarqs* for physics experiments.

> **Note:** The **WT-SIT Spectrometron** is currently deprecated due to game balancing.

### New Part: Y-CKY Goo Chamber (Coming Soon!)
A new research module designed for bulk experimentation with **Mystery Goo™**. This specialized chamber will require significant quantities of Goo per experiment and will unlock a new **Chemistry** research chain.


### Experiment Pods:
Experiments are conducted using size 1 pods. These pods dock with your space station and are brought back to the surface or data can be transmitted back to Kerbin for Science points. Pods are not re-runnable, so plan accordingly.

## Research Trees

Station Science experiments are divided into four core disciplines:
- **Biology (Plants)**
- **Physiology (Creatures)**
- **Physics (Kuarqs)**
- **Chemistry (Goo)**

Each discipline has its own experiment tree that increases in complexity as you progress. Here's a breakdown of the experiment tiers:

| **Discipline**        | **Tier 1**                     | **Tier 2**                  | **Tier 3**                          | **Tier 4**                    |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Biology / Plants       | Seed Growth                    | Nutritional Value            | Irradiated Plant Adaptation         | Transgenic Agriculture         |
| Physiology / Creatures | Zoology Observations            | Creature Comforts            | Bio-Goo-volution                    | Super Creature Genesis         |
| Physics / Kuarqs       | Prograde Kuarqs                | Retrograde Kuarqs            | Kuarq Bio-activity                  | Nu-Kuarq Particle Fusion       |


Each experiment requires resources such as *Eurekas*, *Bioproducts*, *Kuarqs*, or *Solutions* to complete. You’ll also need to finalize experiments by using the **Finalize Results** action, generating Science points. Make sure your space station stays in a stable orbit throughout the duration of the experiments to avoid aborting them.

### New Chemistry Research Chain: (Coming Soon!)
Explore the mysteries of **Mystery Goo™** with the **Y-CKY Goo Chamber**, unlocking a whole new branch of research related to *Chemistry*. This will introduce advanced Goo-related experiments and interactions with existing disciplines.


| **Discipline**        | **Tier 1**                     | **Tier 2**                  | **Tier 3**                          | **Tier 4**                    |
| Chemistry / Goo        | Mystery Goo™ Disclosure        | Goo Understanding            | Goo-induced Symbiosis               | Solved Goo™ Alchemy            |

## Contracts

In **Career Mode**, contracts for station science experiments become available once you’ve visited a celestial body and unlocked the required labs and experiment pods. To complete these contracts:
1. Perform the experiment in orbit.
2. Return the experiment pod to Kerbin for recovery and completion.

### Upcoming Contract Overhaul: (Coming Soon!)
The contract system will be expanded, providing more opportunities for advanced station-based science missions across the solar system.
