	Thanks to forum user @xmnovotny for these two fixes:
		Fixed error of loading science requirement definitions.
		Fixed typo (both typo and case issue) with name of BIOPRODUCTS by replacing bad text with already-defined constant

2.6.1
	Thanks to github user @Carnildo for these:
		Remove broken 'Starved' display logic. As a side effect, fixes incorrect 'Running' status display and permits the display of the 'Idle', 'Stored', and 'BadLocation' statuses.
		Only show the 'Can't perform experiment' message if the experiment is running. Eliminates message spam during launch.
		Prevent an NRE if StationExperiment.CheckBoring() is called before StationExperiment.OnStart(). This can happen because CheckBoring() is called from StationScienceModule.PreProcessing()

		Updated descriptions of the Experiment: Plant Growth
		Added a full set of science reports for Experiment: Prograde Kuarqs.
		Added Retrograde and Eccentric Kuarqs reports
